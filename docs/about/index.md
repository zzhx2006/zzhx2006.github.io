# About

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Nanchang University in Jiangxi, China. If you're a fellow computer science student at Nanchang University, I would be delighted to share with you some of my academic and life experiences.

I have no interest in games, novels, movies, or TV series. In fact, discussing these topics might put me to sleep.

I'm deeply interested in cryptography. If you'd like to exchange [GPG public keys](../assets/public-key.gpg), or are looking for a like-minded partner to practice encrypted communication, please feel free to reach out. Together, we can explore a variety of fascinating cryptographic experiments.

I contribute to the maintenance of the Simplified Chinese translation for [the Translation Project's GCC software package](https://translationproject.org/domain/gcc.html). If you're also interested in getting involved and giving back to the open-source community, feel free to reach out—I'd be happy to support and guide you.

I'm an amateur radio enthusiast with the call sign `BG5JMT`. You can look me up on [QRZ](https://www.qrz.com/db/bg5jmt). If you're also on the air, I sincerely hope we might one day make contact over the radio waves.

I am an honest and open person, eager to share knowledge and experiences. I believe in mutual respect, mutual understanding, sincere communication, and calm, rational dialogue.
